# Manual Reference Counting

Answer the following questions inline with this document.

1. Are there memory leaks with this code? (If so, where are the leaks?)

	```swift
	NSString *quote = @"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. - Steve Jobs";

	NSCharacterSet *punctuationSet = [NSCharacterSet punctuationCharacterSet]; // Extra retain count, remove `retain`

	NSString *cleanQuote = [[quote componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:punctuationSet] componentsJoinedByString:@""];
	NSArray *words = [[cleanQuote lowercaseString] componentsSeparatedByString:@" "];

	NSMutableDictionary<NSString *, NSNumber *> *wordFrequency = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];

	for (NSString *word in words) {
		NSNumber *count = wordFrequency[word];
		if (count) {
			wordFrequency[word] = [NSNumber numberWithInteger:count.integerValue + 1];
		} else {
			wordFrequency[word] = [[NSNumber alloc] initWithInteger:1];
		}
	}

	printf("Word frequency: %s", wordFrequency.description.UTF8String);
	[wordFrequency release]; // Created with init, so needs to be released when done with
	```

	2. Rewrite the code so that it does not leak any memory with ARC disabled

2. Which of these objects is autoreleased?  Why?

	1. `NSDate *yesterday = [NSDate date];` // autoreleased, convenience class method
	
	2. `NSDate *theFuture = [[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:60] retain];`
	
	3. `NSString *name = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"John Sundell"];`
	
	4. `NSDate *food = [NSDate new];`
	
	5. `LSIPerson *john = [[LSIPerson alloc] initWithName:name];`
	
	6. `LSIPerson *max = [[[LSIPerson alloc] initWithName:@"Max"] autorelease];` // autoreleased, using `autorelease` keyword

3. Explain when you need to use the `NSAutoreleasePool`.


An NSAutoreleasePool is needed when using large objects in loops, to autorelease sooner than at the end of the entire loop.


4. Implement a convenience `class` method to create a `LSIPerson` object that takes a `name` property and returns an autoreleased object.

```swift
@interface LSIPerson: NSObject

@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *name;

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name;
- (LSIPerson *)named:(NSString *)name;

@end

@implementation LSIPerson

- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name
{
    if (self = [super init]) {
        _name = name;
    }
    return self;
}

- (LSIPerson *)named:(NSString *)name
{
    return [[self initWithName:name] autorelease];
}

@end
```
